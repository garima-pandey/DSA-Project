Analysis of Algorithms:

Analysis of Algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resource required to execute it. Usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithms is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time complexity or volume of memory known as space complexity.

Asymptotic Analysis of Algorithms:

Refers defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its runtime performance. Evaluate the performance of an algorithm in the terms of input size.

Analysis of Types:

1. Best Case
2. Average Case
3. Worst Case

Asymptotic Notation:

1. Big O: Worst Case : Upper Bound
2. Big - Omega: Best Case : Lower Bound
3. Small - o: Worst Case : Upper Bound
4. Small - Omega: Best Case : Lower Bound
5. Theta : Average Case
