DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms

It is the process to manage/arrage the data in a particular structure.
Algorithms: Operations/Functions: CRUD- Create Read Update Delete, Search

Optimized: efficient use of resources(time, space)

Searching: Linear , Binary, Hashing

Sorting
Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quicksort, Heap, Bucket, Shell
