Stack: 

Call stack

A call stack is a stack data structute that is used to trace the sequence of the function call.

Push: when we call a function
Pop: When function return back to function call

Three concepts of Recursion:

1. Base Case or Stop condition
2. Small Problem
3. Processing Logic

Type of Recursion

1. Tail Recursion

If a recursion function is calling itself and that recursive call is the last statement in 
the function. After that call there is nothing, it is not performing anything.

2. Head Recursion

3. Linear Recursion

4. Tree Recursion

5. Indirect Recursion

6. Stack Falling

7. Stack Building


Task:

1. Fibonacci
2. Reverse a String
3. Even Odd (1 to 10)
