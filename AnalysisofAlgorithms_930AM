Analysis of Algorithms:

Analysis of Algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resource required to execute it. Usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time complexity or volume of memory known as space complexity.

Asymptotic Analysis of Algorithms:

Refers defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its runtime performance. Evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size.

Linear and Constant Complexity

Analysis Types:

1. Best case
2. Average Case
3. Worst Case

Asymptotic Notation:

1. Big O: worst case : Upper bound
2. Big - Omega: best case : Lower bound
3. small - o: worst case : Upper bound
4. Small - omega(w) : best case : Lower bound
5. Theta : average case
